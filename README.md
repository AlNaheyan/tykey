tykey

minimal terminal typing test (monkeytypeâ€‘like) built with Go and Bubble Tea.
[press enter and start typing away]

Inspired by @trish on X.

git clone https://github.com/alnaheyan/tykey.git
cd tykey

go run .
```

Optional: build a binary

```bash
go build -o tykey
./tykey
```

Requirements
- Go installed (matches the version in `go.mod`)

This is a learning-based project I made so leave any features wanted in issues.
